Matched Word: [Dictionary keyword]
Match Type: [Exact/Partial/Phonetic]
Confidence: [High/Medium/Low]

Instructions:
- Use efficient string matching algorithms.
- Implement caching for frequent queries.
- Utilize parallel processing for large dictionaries.
- Apply heuristic rules to quickly filter candidates.
